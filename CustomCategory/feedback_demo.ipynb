    "# Model dissatisfaction mitigation for customized category classifiction\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is designed to assist users in resolving dissatisfaction encountered during model evaluation. Incorrectly classified samples are often due to the class description or sample data not encompassing all possible issues. These problems can be resolved by modifying the description or adding relevant samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following content includes how to use GPT4 to automatically adjust the description and sample based on dissatisfaction:\n",
    "1. step 1: LLM reasoning for feedback\n",
    "2. step 2: Edit the description according to the reasoning if necessary\n",
    "3. step 3: Create more related samples for training\n",
    "4. step 4: retrain the model\n",
    "\n",
    "**(Important) Since the category could be sensitive, this guidance would use LLM to do the recommendation, and the generated content may violate safety policy. We suggest users to turn off content filtering of the LLM resource to get better model performance.**"
